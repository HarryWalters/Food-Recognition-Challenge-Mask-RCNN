# Food-Recognition-Challenge-Mask-RCNN
In my initial tinkering with the challenge, I found matterport's implementation of [MaskRCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) to be a formidable image segmentation model. 

# Requirements
See `requirements.txt`
* Python 3.4, 
* TensorFlow 1.3
* Keras 2.0

# Results
After finetuning the heads, this model acheived an Average Precision of 0.188 & an Average Recall of 0.243.
While enough to place my model in the top 6 internationally, I decided to explore other learning methods and models in later work.
