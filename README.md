# Food-Recognition-Challenge-Mask-RCNN
My entry into Seerave Foundation's Food Recognition challenge. This uses [open-mmlab](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)'s Hybrid Task Cascade model, based on a ResNet 50 backend.

## MMdetection's Requirements
* Linux (Windows is not officially supported)
* Python 3.5+
* PyTorch 1.1 or higher
* CUDA 9.0 or higher
* NCCL 2
* GCC 4.9 or higher

To install mmdetection, I decided *(read: was **forced**)* to run a dualboot of Ubuntu and Windows 10 on my workstation.
